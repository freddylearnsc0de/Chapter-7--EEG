    "### A priori *t* test\n",
    "A common approach to testing whether an ERP effect is significant is to perform a *t* test between a pair of conditions, on the ERP data averaged over a time period of interest and at one or a few electrodes. Ideally, the experimenter should have an *a priori* (i.e., defined prior to running the experiment) hypothesis regarding the time window and electrodes at which the ERP component and experimental effect of interest would be largest. In the present case, we predicted an N400, which we knew from previous studies with similar stimuli would likely be largest between 400–600 ms, at electrode Pz. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we will use the `ttest_1samp()` function from SciPy's `stats` module. This tests whether a set of values are different from zero. So we use as input the *Violation-Control* differences for each participant, since if they are significantly different from zero, that will be evidence for a difference in amplitude between these two conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "So here we first compute the average over the 400–600 ms time window, for each participant, at electrode Pz, and store these in a NumPy array on which we then perform the *t* test. We create the NumPY array in a single line of code, but it's a fairly complex one:\n",

We apply `np.mean()` to the result of `get_data`, to average across the 400-600 ms time window. We pass the `axis=1` kwarg because the NumPy array will be 2D, with a row for each electrode (in this case, only 1 row), and columns for time. So `axis=1` tells `np.mean()` to average over columns (axis 1; time) and not rows (axis 0; electrodes).\n",

    "## Permutation *t* test and multiple comparison correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to perform a *t* test at *every* electrode, so that we can visualize a statistical map of values across the scalp. This has the advantage of potentially revealing the true scalp distribution of an experimental effect, rather than being limited to the channel(s) predicted a priori to show the effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this increases our risk of false positives (Type I error). This is because when we perform a *t* test and use the resulting *p* value to determine statistical significance, we typically pick a threshold for significance (alpha, or $\\alpha$) based on the probability of finding a result by chance, if no experimental effect were actually present. In other words, if we use an $\\alpha$ of .05, this means there is on average a 5% probability of finding that result by chance.  However, that is based on the assumption that we ran only one statistical test. If we run multiple statistical tests, and use *p* ≤ .05 as our threshold, then we increase the odds of finding at least one \"significant\" result by chance. Most intuitively, if we perform 100 statistical tests and use *p* ≤ .05 on each, then we are likely to end up with 5 of those results being incorrect (5/100 = 5%).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the present data we have data from 64 electrodes for each participant. One way to correct for multiple comparisons is the **Bonferroni** method, which involves simply dividing the desired $\\alpha$ value for the experiment (i.e., across all tests) by the number of tests. For this data set that would mean $.05 / 64 = 0.00078$. However, the Bonferroni correction assumes that each statistical test is independent of the others, which is not true for multiple channels of EEG data — nearby channels can be predicted to have similar values, since they are measuring activity from nearby scalp locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several alternative ways of controlling for multiple comparisons. One is to perform a **permutation** *t* test. Widely introduced to the field of neuroimaging by [Nichols and Holmes (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.1058) permutation is a well-established approach in the field of statistics. The basic concepts in permutation testing are *exchangability* and *randomization*. If we have multiple data points from two sets of experimental conditions (e.g., *Violation* and *Control*), and there is no true difference between the conditions, then it should not matter if we perform a *t* test between the data points using the correct condition labels, or if we randomly re-label the condition of each data point (i.e., *exchange* the labels among data points). In other words, if ERP amplitude in the *Violation* and *Control* conditions are not truly different, then if we scramble which data points we call *Violation* and which ones we call *Control*, and perform the *t* test again, the results of that *t* test should not be too different from the \"correct\" *t* test. On the other hand, if there is a true experimental effect, then randomizing the labels of each data point should result in consistently lower *t* values than the true labeling. The reason this approach is called *permutation* testing is that we perform the random exchange of labels and data points many times, each with a different reassignment (i.e., a different permutation of labels and data points). Typically this is done thousands of times, in order to get a reliable estimate of the *null distribution* — that is, the distribution of *t* scores across different permutations that we know don't match the true label-to-data-point mapping. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach doesn't in and of itself correct for multiple comparisons. However, when permutation tests are performed over a number of different sets of data (such as a separate *t* test on the data from each individual electrode), we can can use this to correct for multiple comparisons. This is called the **maximal statistic** method. It is based on the recognition that the distribution of *t* (and associated *p*) values across thousands of random permutations of labels actually reflects the \"chance\" that our use *p* values are based on. In other words, in conventional *t* tests if we use an $\\alpha$ of .05, then we are saying that we accept a 5% chance that over many replications of the experiment we would get a \"significant\" result by chance. Since our permutation distribution actually *is* thousands of replications of an \"experiment\" in which there is no true effect, we can say that the top 5% of the *t* values we obtain from the permutations are what we consider \"significant\". We can provide even better control for multiple comparisons by looking at the maximum *t* values not just at each electrode separately, but across all the electrodes. We can set the critical *t* value (i.e., the *t* threshold for significance) to be $(\\alpha * N) + 1$, where $N$ is the number of electrodes. That is, our *t* threshold is set so that just under 5% of the randomly-obtained *t* values are greater than this threshold. "
