    "One challenge in working with the raw data directly in this way, is that we normally think of, and work with, EEG data in terms of units of time, such as seconds or milliseconds. However, EEG data is not always (or even usually) sampled at 1000 Hz, so each time point doesn't correspond to 1 ms. For example, in our current data set, the sampling rate was 500 Hz, so each time point reflects a period of 2 ms. This makes accessing specific time points or time ranges in the data tricky, because if you want, say, the data from 1500-1800 ms in the `raw` data, you would need to first convert those times to seconds (since `sfreq` is in samples per second), convert the result to `int` (since division is likely to yield a `float` result), then multiply each of those times by the sampling rate to get the correct indices.

The bottom axis shows the timeline of the entire raw EEG recording, with a dark vertical bar near the start indicating the position in the file that is currently plotted. Although it doesn't work in web-based Jupyter environments like CoCalc, if you install Python on your own computer and run MNE you will get an interactive plot, that allows you to scroll through the data over time."

    "One thing that can be useful at this stage is visualizing the electrode positions on the head. Typically, EEG studies try to position electrodes in a fairly evenly-spaced way over the top of the head. However, the locations can depend on what ERP [components](./components) are predicted for the study, and how many electrodes are available. \n",
    "\n",
    "MNE provides a `.plot_sensors()` method for visualizing sensor locations. However, by default although our raw data contains the *names* of each channel, it does not contain information regarding where each channel was located. Fortunately, in this and most EEG studies, the electrode positions were based on the International 10-20 system. This was first introduced as a way of standardizing EEG electrode placement in clinical neurology, and is so-named because electrode positions are determined by first measuring the anterior-posterior and left-right dimensions of the participant's head, and then placing electrodes at positions determined by 10 and 20% increments of those measurements (E.g., electrode Cz is placed 50% of the anterior-posterior and left-right measurements). More recently, [Oostenveld and Praamstra (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1388-2457(00)00527-7) published an extension of this called the 10-5 system, that allows for a larger number of electrodes based on 5% increments. You can read more about this system and its variants on [Oostenveld's blog](https://robertoostenveld.nl/electrode/#oostenveld2001). \n",
    "\n",
    "Long story short, we have to first run an MNE method to look up the locations of each electrode based on its 10-20 system name, and set the positions in the raw file. We do this with `.set_montage()`, and as an argument use MNE's built-in list of 10-5 system electrode names and locations.\n",
