    "**Event codes** indicate when events of experimental interest occurred during the EEG recording. They are typically generated by the stimulus computer, and sent to the EEG recording computer at the same time that the stimuli are presented to the participant. Event codes may also mark when a participant made a response (such as a button press, or the onset of a vocal response), or other information such as the start of a new block of trials or condition, rather than a specific stimulus. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Event codes can also be generated by devices that detect when a stimulus occurs. For example, a light-sensitive *photodiode* can be used to detect when the brightness of a location on a computer screen changes. This setup can be useful in some situations, because sometimes there is an unpredictable delay between the time that the computer software initiates presentation of a stimulus, and when the hardware actually presents the stimulus. These delays are typically only on the order of a few, or possibly tens, of milliseconds, but that is enough to cause problems when averaging ERPs from multiple trials together — especially if the delay is inconsistent across trials. The result will be that the peaks and troughs of the waveforms do not align perfectly across trials, and the resulting averaged ERP will look more smoothed and less \"peaky\". Event codes can also be generated by devices that detect when a stimulus occurs. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Segmenting the data into ERPs depends on these event codes, since they are what we time-lock to. To use them for ERP segmentation, we need to first extract the timing and identity of each code from the raw data, and store it in a NumPy array. Because event codes are numeric (for reasons explained below), we also need to define a mapping between these numbers and meaningful labels (such as what type of stimulus or experimental condition the code denotes).

It's very simple and low-level, and is done via the parallel port of a computer (which is so low-level, computers almost never have these built in anymore). The reason this arcane system is still routinely used in EEG is that its timing is very precise, which means it is the best option to get millisecond-level synchronization between when the stimulus computer presents a stimulus, and when the event code is received by the EEG system. This level of precision is vital in EEG research because the effects of interest occur on a millisecond time scale. The impact of this system for us is that the event codes stored in an EEG data file are usually restricted to integers in the range of 1–255, because that is the (8 bit) resolution of the TTL protocol (i.e., this kind of connection can inherently only send this range of values). Some EEG recording software allows the experimenter to specify text labels for each numerical event code, based on what the numbers mean in that particular experiment. However, in most cases mapping between the numerical event codes and meaningful labels is something we do in preprocessing, as shown below.\n",

    "This data set was collected while the participant viewed a series of pictures of objects on a computer screen.

Based on prior research, we predicted an **N400** ERP component for the mismatch trials relative to those on which the picture and word matched.\n",

    "The N400 is a component first discovered by [Kutas & Hillyard (1980)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.7350657), in response to sentences that ended in a word whose meaning was not predicted given the preceding words in the sentence. For example, the sentence *I take my coffee with milk and dog.* would elicit an N400 at the word *dog*. More than 40 years of subsequent research has shown that the N400 is a marker of brain processes involved in integrating new information into an ongoing context that people maintain of words and concepts — or in technical terms, *semantic integration*. Violations of expectations related to the meaning of stimuli evoke an N400 response. In the present experiment, we did not use sentences, however each picture created a context and the subsequent word either fit (matched) or did not fit (mismatched) that context. \n",

This is because in this study, the experimenters coded details of the stimuli in great detail. This is common in research, where we have one central research question, but perhaps other questions relating to more fine-grained details of the stimuli. As well, the stimuli may vary in ways that are not of experimental interest, but are properties that we would like to control for. For now we will label each event code.\n",

Later we will merge them before examining the ERPs, but for now we will label each one separately. This preserves the more detailed information, in case later we decide we want to break the data down in a more fine-grained fashion."

    "Finally, we split the continuous, filtered raw EEG data into epochs time-locked to the event codes of interest, as defined in `event_mapping`. To do this we use `mne.Epochs()`, which creates an object of the class `Epochs`. A number of arguments are necessary; the first 5 of these are *positional* arguments, meaning that the first 5 argument positions must have specific contents:\n",
    "- the first is the raw data. We pass the filtered data.\n",
    "- the next two arguments are the events array, and the mapping of events to labels\n",
    "- the fourth and fifth arguments are the start and end times of each epoch (`timn` and `tmax`), relative to the event code. Typically the minimum (start) time is a negative number, because for reasons explained below we want a *baseline* period to compare to the activity after the event code (typically 50-200 ms, but sometimes longer). The stop time depends on the timing of the ERP components you expect to occur. Some types of stimuli and experiments (such as studies of attention, or face processing) may only be interested in ERPs that occur within the first 500 ms after stimulus presentation. In language studies, interesting effects often occur up to 1 s or even longer after a word is presented. An important thing to note is that these times need to be specified in *seconds* (which is a bit counter-intuitive because we commonly talk about the timing of ERPs in milliseconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "After these 5 required positional arguments, there are many kwargs we can specify. For our purposes, the defaults for most of these are fine. The one we will specify is `reject=`, which applies a threshold, in microVolts, for marking a trial as an artifact. This threshold was determined by the `get_rejection_threshold()` function earlier, and saved in the variable `reject`. This is used to remove excessive noise from the data set that can't be corrected with ICA. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `baseline` kwarg specifies what time period to use as the baseline for each epoch. The baseline is the period before the stimulus onset, and it is used to define \"zero\" voltage for each trial. This is necessary because  the measured electrical potentials can drift quite a lot over the course of the experiment (even after we filter out the lowest-frequency drift). So the absolute microVolt values for any given epoch might be rather different from other ones, due to drift. By subtracting the mean amplitude over the baseline period from each trial (and for each channel), we \"centre\" the measurements for that trial such that the potentials after the onset of each event code reflect the deviations of our measurements from the baseline period. Put another way, the measurements of each epoch reflect any changes in electrical potential that occur after the event code, relative to the baseline period before it. We use `(None, 0)` for the baseline to specify the time period from the start of the epoch to the time of the event code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also include the `preload=True` kwarg. As with `raw` data, MNE tries to save memory by not keeping the epoched data in memory unless it is needed. However, below we will need it and so we force MNE to store this in the data here. \n",
