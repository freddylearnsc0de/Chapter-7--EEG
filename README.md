# Chapter 7 EEG materials
[This chapter](https://neuraldatascience.io/7-eeg/introduction.html) covers electroencephalography (EEG), a technique for non-invasively measuring electrical activity from electrodes placed on the scalp.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Explain the neural origins of EEG data

- Explain, in basic terms, how EEG is recorded

- Explain the difference between time- and frequency-domain treatments of EEG data

- Explain the rationale for fundamental EEG data preprocessing operations, including:

  - filtering

  - event code processing

  - segmentation (epoching)

  - artifact removal

  - averaging

- Describe the purpose of the MNE-Python software package

- Use MNE-Python to perform the above EEG preprocessing steps

- Use MNE-Python to visualize EEG data in the time and frequency domains, including

  - waveform plots of one or more electrodes

  - scalp topography plots

  - frequency spectra

  - time-frequency plots

- Convert processed EEG data from MNE-Python to a pandas DataFrame

- Plot averaged EEG data using Seaborn
